**trigo** is a **peer-to-peer cross-border purchasing platform** that connects buyers in Taiwan with travelers who can purchase and deliver products for them. Think **StockX meets international shopping**â€”buyers request products, and sellers (travelers) fulfill orders for a fee.

**How It Works:**

- **Buyers**: Browse requested items or submit a request for specific products.
- **Sellers (Travelers)**: See open requests, purchase the item abroad, and deliver it to Taiwan in exchange for a profit.
- **Seamless Transactions**: **trigo** facilitates payments, ensures security, and provides an escrow system to protect both parties.
